Python/Django Assignment

Hello Sir, 
In the assignment given to me I have done web development and websocket integration task which is as follows -

Web development - I have created crud API and prepared frontend with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and integrated RestAPI with front-end. The web development part could also have been done using the Django template language, but I have used the Django template and integrated the API with the front-end.

WebSocket Integration - Implement WebSocket to enable real-time communication between the server andclients using Django Channels. Develop real-time features chat functionality.

How to Run Project

* Web Development

py manage.py runserver --> run this command in terminal

1. http://127.0.0.1:8000/ ---> using this url you can see all Api's.
2. http://127.0.0.1:8000/register/ ---> signup page
3. http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/ ---> login page
